            <p class="about-text">
                EdTech is an intermediary technology platform which provides online classes to K12 and working professionals on English Communication, Public Speaking, Grammar, Creative Writing, Debating, Vlogging and other 'new age' skills. The classes are delivered by our hand-picked teachers, who are professionals and have extensive experience in delivering such classes.
                EdTech is on a journey to make the traditional and unorganized tuitions obsolete through its virtual classroom.
                India's edtech sector has great potential
                India's edtech sector is growing rapidly and has the potential to transform education and drive socioeconomic growth. The Indian government's investment in education and the country's large population and growing economy are creating a favorable environment for edtech companies. 
                Edtech can make learning easier
                Edtech can make communication between teachers and students easier, and can help students behave better. Apps can send reminders to students and parents about homework and projects, and tools can help students monitor classroom noise levels. 
                Edtech can enhance teaching and learning
                Edtech can enhance teaching and learning in a blended learning environment. Teachers can use e-content like a textbook, and can also use shorter, more engaging content, continuous feedback, and smaller group discussions. 
                Edtech can help students learn from a distance
                Edtech allows people to learn almost anything from a distance, at any time or place. The internet has become the primary form of distance education.
